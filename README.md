# Summary

The analysis of the UFO Sightings results shows that:
- The web site is using a JSON file that is not stored in database. This can be a drawback when the volume of the data grows.
- One recommendation is to use database such as PostgreSQL to store the data.
- Another recommendation is to add search button where the user can click to search the specific UFO sightings
